                    Hi, my name's Daniel and I'm an aspiring software developer. I studied Physics at university and worked as
                    a research assistant in an atomic physics laboratory for 2 years upon graduation. I am currently embarking on
                    a career transition from physics to software development by studying for my <a href="https://www.iss.nus.edu.sg/graduate-programmes/programme/detail/graduate-diploma-in-systems-analysis">Graduate Diploma in Systems Analysis</a>
                    at the National University of Singapore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm on the lookout for job opportunities in fullstack web development. I also have a general interest in
                    science and technology. I'm on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielchua93/">LinkedIn</a> if you'd like to connect! :)
